#### Hi there 👋 I'm Ali, a passionate backend developer, who loves creating cool and fun projects. 🚀
##### In my toolkit, you'll find Node.js and Express for crafting robust backend systems. I'm also well-versed in managing databases, whether it's the structured world of SQL or the flexible realm of NoSQL. Let's build something awesome together!


I'm also passionate about the captivating worlds of technology, art, and history👀 
I asked my MongoDB if it wanted to join me for a relational dinner. It said, "NoSQL, thanks!" 😒😁
