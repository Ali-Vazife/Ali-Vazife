#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ali, a backend developer âœ¨ weaving wonders with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. ðŸš€ JavaScript is my playground. Beyond the code, I'm passionate about exploring the intersections of technology, art, and history. ðŸŽ¨

**I asked my MongoDB if it wanted to join me for a relational dinner. It said, "NoSQL, thanks!"**
